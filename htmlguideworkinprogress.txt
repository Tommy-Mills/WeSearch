<openingtag>
Tags are encapsulating information about the content you're filling out. 
You will almost always need an opening tag for every closing tag.
They are signified by <> and </> respectively.
</closingtag>

<a href="https://www.google.com/">This link is to another page. The tag for a link is <a> and to add a hyperlink set the href quality = a website or file url in quotes</a>

<hr> <!--This makes a horizontal line.-->
<br/> <!--This is like the enter button, starts on a new line-->
<img /> is the tag used to add images. You need to keep the picture you want it to show in the same folder, and set the quality src = the file url.
<img src = "image.png"/> It is a self closing tag, with the / included in the tag, so do not worry about closing it.
This creates an image in the page (<img...) and sets the image to be shown to this file (src = "image.png") and then closes (/>)

<p>
This is a text holder. These tags are paragraph tags.
</p>

<div>
This is another text holder.
</div>

<span>
This is yet another text holder. These tags are supposed to hold what is inside on the same line.
</span>

<div class = "row">
This is a text holder with a class specified that is called row.
</div>
