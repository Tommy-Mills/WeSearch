SWEN Project

Welcome to our SWEN101 Project!
WeSearch is an app that focuses on helping communities conduct and participate in research. <br/>
You can create articles, surveys, and interviews, and share them with others. You can read  <br/>
about and follow new research in your community, or begin some of your own and publish articles. <br/>
