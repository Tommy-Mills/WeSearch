# WeSearch
SWEN Project

Welcome to our SWEN101 Project!
WeSearch is an app that focuses on helping communities conduct and participate in research. You can create articles, surveys, and interviews, and share them with others. You can read about and follow new research in your community, or begin some of your own and publish articles.
